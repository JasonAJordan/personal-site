        </h1>

        <p>
            Hi I'm Jason Akira Jordan. Ever since Highschool I wanted to be a software devoloper / computer scientist of sorts however 
            I was convinced into studying Mechanical Engineering due to my ablities in mathematics and love for fixing just about anything. 
            Even though Mech Engineering was pretty cool and all it turns out I would still rather be a software devoloper. 
        </p>

        <p>
            I decided I should take my career seriously because well it's my life and I should do what I find intresting. 
            In the summer of 2020 I quit my job and applied for a few coding bootcamps. 
            I got accepted into every bootcamp that I applied for however I decided to go with Flatiron in the end. 
        </p>
