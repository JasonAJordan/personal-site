        <p>
            Hi I'm Jason Akira Jordan. Ever since Highschool I wanted to be a software devoloper / computer scientist of sorts however 
            I was convinced into studying Mechanical Engineering due to my ablities in mathematics and love for fixing just about anything. 
            Even though Mech Engineering was pretty cool and all it turns out I would still rather be a software devoloper.
